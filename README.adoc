== Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed with link:{url-poetry}[`poetry`].
You can set up a virtual environment and the dependencies with `poetry install`.


== Tests and Linting

The `Makefile` contains several examples how the unit-tests and various linters can be run using poetry.
Of course, you can use `make` directly, too.

This project also uses link:{url-pre-commit}[`pre-commit`] to automatically set up Git pre-commit hooks that run the relevant code formatting and linting tools.
You can set it up by running `poetry run pre-commit install`.
Then the code will be automatically formatted before every commit.
